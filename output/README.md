# Coursework Project - ST2195 Programming for Data Science

Complete dataset along with its supllementary informations are available for download from the Harvard Dataverse at http://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7

Scope of coursework:
- Choose at least two consecutive years of dataset
- Answer the following 5 questions:
	1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?
	2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
	3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
	4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
	5. Use the available variables to contruct a model that predicts delays.
	
All answers should be collated in a sturcutred report not exceeding 10 pages (excluding title, references and table of contents).
